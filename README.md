# Roadmap to Future Improvements
It was interesting jumping from focusing on the color change to then having X and O as the state to watch. I would like to implement having the whole square for X turn Black with white X and then White Square with black O for the board. Make it look a little more "50's era." I believe to do this, the color state would not be set to random, it would be set to follow the state of the x or o click.Â
